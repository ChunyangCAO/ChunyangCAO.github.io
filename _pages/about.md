My name is Chunyang CAO and I am an undergraduate student at City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. My final year project is focusing on random matrix application to correlations among the volatility of assets - a topic I explore by applying GARCH and Marchenkoâ€“Pastur distribution to volatility of returns for small stock portfolios. I am also interested in valuation of options and used Monte Carlo simulation to value specific Asian options. I am now applying for master programs of financial engineering and financial mathematics in American universities.
